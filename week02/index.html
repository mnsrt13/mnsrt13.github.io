            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <h2 style = "text-align:left;" "font-size: 20px;"><i>As We May Think</i> by Vannevar Bush (1945) and <i>Long Live the Web</i> Tim Berners Lee (2010)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align:left;" "font-size: 15px;">As I read Bush's work, one thought lingered in my mind, "flying cars and floating cities." I recalled a
                 moment in my childhood, where I played with my friends and overheard the adult's conversation. It was about the future after reminiscing about their 
                 past. "In a few years, there will be flying cars and futuristic architecture," they said as they looked up at the sky and sipped some tea. They were 
                 amazed by how fast technology had evolved and only to facilitate their lives.</p>

            <p style = "text-align:left;" "font-size: 15px;">Bush wrote of the current methods of photography and videography that existed in his time and mentioned 
                the possibility of dry photography in his work. Now dry photography exists, and it has become a part of people's daily lives, capturing a person's 
                irreplaceable memories and once-in-a-lifetime events. It reinforced the importance of maintaining records. The human race, along with ideas, will continue
                 to exists. As long as the records of the past that withhold centuries of knowledge remain, advancements in technology and other fields will continue to
                  grow to achieve the unachievable. It's been a few years, architecture has surpassed my imagination, and there aren't flying cars in the sky, but that 
                  doesn't mean it'll never happen. On the contrary, there may be a future that surpasses this depiction.</p>

            <p style =  "text-align:left;" "font-size: 15px">Burner's Lee addresses how vulnerable the web is. We must protect the web for ourselves and future generations.
                Not only is the web an asset for human growth, but it also poses a threat to our human rights like privacy and freedom of speech. Restrictions could be imposed
                 on the limitless information that lives on the web. If we can protect the web and maintain its universality, there are no boundaries for new information and 
                 services. The web and the internet should also remain as distinct entities because they can only advance independtly. As the title suggests, we must ensure that the web 
                 remains alive and well for a very long time. </p>
